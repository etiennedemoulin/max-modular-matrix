## TODO


- if object is duplicated, arg is not well recalled
  + bootstrapped AND patcherargs should bang before the message is send 
    * normally bootstrapped is the last to bang but in case of duplicate an object it is the opposite

- si pas de config, cr√©er uniquement 1 inlet



## Known issues
- sometimes names and position and not well recalled (normally solved)
