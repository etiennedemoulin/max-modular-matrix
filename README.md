# max-modular-matrix


## TODO

- parse error on load if no name corresponding with current matrix
- sometimes names and position and not well recalled (timeout ?)
- update matrix if the config file is saved
- if object is duplicated, @config arg is not well recalled (because of zl.reg)

## Known issues
- patcher cords are not recalled when a patch is loaded
